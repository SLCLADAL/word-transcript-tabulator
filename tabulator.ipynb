    "# Word Transcript Tabulator Recipe\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a computational recipe to help you to take a collection of transcripts in word documents (_docx_ only) and turn them into a structured tabular format suitable for working with computational text analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a side-effect of this, it will also help you check for and identify some inconsistencies in your transcripts (for example, inconsistent speaker identifiers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this approach will remove all formatting from your text: if you have information in *bold*, _italics_, or elements highlighted in different colours that information will be lost in this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Upload your transcripts in `.docx` format to the transcripts folder.\n",
    "2. Run the script to produce an initial file for examination and manual changes.\n",
    "3. Check that the headers have been correctly been identified. (How???)\n",
    "4. Use the produced metadata to identify and fix inconsistencies in the transcripts *in word* - reupload any changed versions and try again.\n",
    "5. Fill in the metadata for speaker_codes and speakers. (Match codes in transcripts to speaker_ids, give details known about speakers).\n",
    "\n",
    "(This is going to need screenshots...)\n",
